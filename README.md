Double click the .msi File and follow instruction on the screen.

## Prerequisite
- Currently League of Legends needs to be in "Borderless" Graphics mode for CUELegendKeys to work.
  Once in Game, press ESC, choose "Video" and set "Windowed Mode" to "Borderless"
- Adjust your League of Legends Interface HUD-Scale to your favorite size.

** First Start
- Start CUELegendKeys and League of Legends
- Rightclick on CUELegendKeys Window and Select "Learn"
  a new window (that is always on top) will open with the learn interface.
- To calibrate CUELegendKeys, start a training game.
  Choose "Play", "Training", "Tutorial"
- Once in the game - click "ok" on the dialoge box and than DO NOTHING ELSE in League of Legends
  (except walking arount to aviod AFK detection)
- Click the First button (passive) on the top of the calibration window
  - Click "Learn"
    While learning, CUELegendKeys tries to find the icon on the screen.
    After some seconds the searched icon will appear in the big frame on the right.
    If not, you can switch to other place of discovery with some arrow buttons next to the Learn button.1

    The borders of the icon does not need to fit to the yellow markers exactly, but that's ok for now.
    Press "Save" and continue to the next item.

    Continue this step for all Buttons on the top.
- Close Learn Window
- Leave the Game
- Start a new "Custom Game" (just you and the Minions) and use a favorite champ.
- Buy an Active item (a ward for example) and level up your 4 skills.
- Rightclick on CUELegendKeys Window and Select "Learn"
- Click a button on the top of the calibration window you want to edit.
  - Match the 4 yellow border markers to the right position.
  - The "golden" icon border needs to be exactly wrapped into the yellow markers.
  - Click "Save".
  - After that, you should see the corresponding key behaving correctly.
- Once you've done that for all function: Congratulations! Everything is done!
- Close "Learn" Window
- Leave Game

Now you can play as you like!

** How does it work
CUELegendKey detects if League of Legends is running and constantly makes "Screenshots" of the Game.
It analyzes the HUD Interface and lighten specific keys on you keyboard in correct colors.
That's it!

** Is it ok for Riot, or is it cheating?
I don't know - i don't ask them yet. Use it on your own risk.
